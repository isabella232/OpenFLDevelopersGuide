# Chapter 1: Handling events {#chapter-1-handling-events}

An event-handling system allows programmers to respond to user input and system events in a convenient way. The OpenFL event model is not only convenient, but also standards-compliant, and well integrated with the display list. Based on the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification, an industry-standard event- handling architecture, the new event model provides a powerful yet intuitive event-handling tool for Haxe programmers.

The OpenFL event-handling system interacts closely with the display list. To gain a basic understanding of the display list, read [Display programming](..\display-programming\README.md).
