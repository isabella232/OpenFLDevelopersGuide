# Chapter 2: Display programming {#chapter-10-display-programming}

Visual elements are programmed in Haxe by working with display objects on the display stage. For example, you can add, move, remove, and order display objects, apply filters and masks, draw vector and bitmap graphics, and perform three-dimensional transformations using the OpenFL display programming API. The primary classes used for display programming are part of the [openfl.display package](http://api.openfl.org/openfl/display/).
